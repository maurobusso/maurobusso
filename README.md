Hello there, I'm a self-taught software developer from Italy, with a background in health care and sport science. I have been living in the UK for the past 6 years and 
I have been studying software development for the past 5 months, in particular have been focusing on HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I am now building projects for my portfolio. I am very excited for this new journey and very eager to learn as much as I can.

# :computer: My coding journey :computer:
I first approached coding when I was 15, I always spent a lot of time on my dad's computer playing and doing anything I could think of. When a day I ask myselfe how does this computer works? how is it able to do what I want it to do? After some googleing, I then stumble across binary code and programming languages that are used to talk to computers. I became really interested and fascinated by this aspect of tecnology, so much so that I tried to teach myself phyton. However, at that time there were not many resources available and there were even less available in Italian, so I tried to learn from a textbook. it goes without saying that I miserably failed. However, the passion for tech stuck with me until I discovered 100Devs a free coding bootcamp that started during lock down to help people that were laid off developer new skill with the aim of obtaining a job in the tech industry. In addition, as one of my last project during university, I developed a website to help people through rehabilitation using wix however that made me realize how much I love building things that can be useful for everyone, and ultimately made me decide to take this to the next level and commit myself to switch career and become a software developer.<br />
